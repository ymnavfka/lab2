This is my laboratory project on the topic of "Algorithms and Data Structures" that I am working on at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.
## The task is:
To develop a clean procedure for sorting lines of a given text in descending order of line length. Use insertion sorting.
An indication. The list item is a string. Use the Len_trim function.
## Additional requirements:
### Necessarily:
* encapsulation
* the next field to be placed
### If necessary (depends on the task):
* inheritance
* polymorphism
* the completed function (if necessary, delete the structure in the task)
